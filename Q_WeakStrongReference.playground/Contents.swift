person.payEmiForHouse(amount: 1230) // So the answer to the first question is â€¦â€¦â€¦.. nothing. Yes, it won't be printing anything. Pat yourself if you got it right. If you look closely, the person class has a weak reference to the credit card object. As the reference is weak, the credit card object, created in the init function of person class, will be instantly deallocated. Why ? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” An object will stay in the memory if its reference count is greater than one. weak references don't increase the reference count. So the object will be deinitialized instantly.

class Pet {
    var name: String?
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

class PersonWithPet {
    weak var pet: Pet?
    
    func makePet() {
        let newPet = Pet(name: "dog")
        self.pet = newPet
    }
}

let personAgain = PersonWithPet()
personAgain .makePet()
print("Pet Name : \(personAgain.pet?.name)") // Here also, the reference to the pet object is weak, but we have assigned a strong object (newPet) to it. So why does it deinitialized? Every reference also has a lifetime, as soon as the reference goes out of the scope the reference count of the object is decreased by one.
